Here the training data is fixed at $n=1000$, while the testing data is allowed to increase from $100$ to $1000$. MMSJ successfully captures the underlying manifolds at $n=1000$, so it is able to maintain an almost perfect matching ratio regardless of the size of the testing data. All other benchmarks have its matching ratio decreasing as the size of the testing data increases, reflecting that the number of the training data is not sufficient for them to fully reveal the underlying manifolds.\relax }}{2}}
